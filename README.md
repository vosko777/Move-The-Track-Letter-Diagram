The system should monitor the vehicles' performance and keep track of the sensors installed in each vehicle, transmitting information about the vehicle, the data and events that occur during the trip. The system should keep track of the trip details like start time, end time, and the vehicle and driver associated with it. The system should also keep track of the road information and events that occur while driving like deviations, accidents, sudden braking, etc. The system should monitor the vehicle's performance by communicating data every 30 seconds about the engine temperature, fuel consumption, tire wear, etc.
